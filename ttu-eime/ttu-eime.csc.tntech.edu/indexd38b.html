Our client requires a bicycle that is subsequent to his exercise needs. We have developed a bicycle that is in conjuncture to his immediate as well as future needs. We have adhered to that by transforming the bicycle into a three wheeled mechanism (trike), as well as adding the feature of a motor to assist with the clients inept  muscles.

== Team members ==
[[File:Eime.jpg|375px]]
*Left to Right: 
**Johnny Scudder
**Jose Mejia
**Andrew Thammavongsa
**Carlos Garcia
**Greyson Moffatt

== Problem Statement/overview of the need ==
This project is about providing an exercise bike that will be functional as well as enjoyable to our client. Our client is an 11 year old child with Autism who is unable to ride a regular bike due to: his weight, balance and coordination as well as muscle tone in both his legs and arms. We propose to provide a bike to encourage our client to use the bike and exercise. 

== Design Parameters  ==
*The bike must be able to assist the passenger with balance: 3 wheeled design (trike)
*Must have an assistive mechanism to help the passenger peddle to a certain extent: assistive motor
*Adjustable to the specifications of the passenger over a long period of time: adjustable seat and handle bars
*Our client must enjoy riding the trike to encourage exercise and fitness: to be decided 

== User Information  ==
*User Dimensions:
**Overall height = 52"
**From waist to bottom of of feet = 29"
**Length of arms (shoulder to wrist) = 17"

== Conceptual Designs ==
Everyone in the group came up with their ideas and proposed a project design, as shown below. We gathered together and discussed everyone's design concepts. Then, we took parts from all the different concepts to create the best design that meets the parameters above. 
=== Design Concept 1 ===
'''Motor Assisted Trike''':
[[File:trike6.jpg|500px|center|]]
* Light weight design to help the trikes portability
* Lower to ground making entry easier
* Frame can easily be adapted from an older bike frame
* Small motor for assistance

=== Design Concept 2 ===
'''Three wheel motor assisted trike''':
[[File:trike7.jpg|400px|center|]]
* Stable 
* Safe
* Simple steering
* Pedal assist systems kits are ready and available

=== Design Concept 3 ===
'''BMX Trike:'''
[[File:trike3.jpg|500px|center|]]
* Two wheels in front and one in back for stability
* A front suspension mirroring a cars front suspension for front wheel maneuverability 
* A hub motor on the rear wheel making the bike generally electric powered
* An independent chain mechanism connected to a pulley system used solely for exercise
* Disk brakes in front wheels

=== Design Concept 4 ===
'''Three wheel assistive pedaling design:'''
[[File:trike5.JPG|400px|center|left|1st scene]]

[[File:trike4.JPG|400px|center|left|1st scene]]
*Pulley system to assist with pedaling
*Adjustable joints to help with comfort
*Straps for pedals to secure feet to a certain extent

=== Design Concept 5 ===
'''Chopper/Recumbent Trike'''
[[File:Concept_5.jpg|500px|center|]]
'''Recumbent:'''
* Lower center of gravity 
* Easier to mount and dismount the trike and ride securely 
* Easier to pedal
* Make the pedals adjustable from the frame of the bike

'''Chopper:'''
* Make the frame in a banana shape for an easily adjustable seat
* Two wheels in back and tilted outwards for stability and turning

=== Proposed Design Concept ===
'''Recumbent trike with pedal assist'''
[[File:trike2.jpg|500px|center|]]
'''Electronics: '''
[[File:Trike power.jpg|500px|center|]]

Analysis:
This Analysis was to find out where the majority of the stress would be applied, as well as whether the part would be able to adhere the force subjected on it.

Conclusions:
1) The von Mises Stress test proves that most of the stress was at the bent juncture.


[[File:Stress Analysis.jpg|500px|center|]]


2) Yes, the part did not fail when subjected to the force, due to the stress not being enough to cause fracture. This was proved via the Max von Mises Stress, which shows that the part is within the Factor of safety.

==== Engineering analysis 3 ====

[[File:Tricycle3.jpg|600px|center|]]


[[File:Bike fork analysis.jpg|500px|center|]]


Expected Outcome: 

For this analysis, we want determine whether the fork is strong enough to withstand the torque the electric motor will be outputting.


Assumptions:

There are basic assumptions. Most bicycles forks are made out of some type of steel. In this case, we used an alloy steel. The analysis was a simple static simulation, where the longer top tube was held fixed. The torque of the electric motor was placed at the bottom part of the fork, where the wheel would be mounted. In addition, we decided to use only one side of the fork. 


Results - Stress &amp; Displacement:

[[File:Bike Fork Stress.jpg|500px|center|]]


[[File:Bike Fork Displacement.jpg|500px|center|]]


Verdict:

As expected, the tricycle's fork will be strong enough to withstand the torque outputted by the electric motor. The majority of the stress and displacement happen at the bottom of the forks, which is the piece that holds the electric motor. The maximum stress is about 15,000 psi and the maximum displacement is less the 1/64th of an inch. Most manufacturers account for all various types of forces applied to the forks, so here will be no further modifications needed.

'''When we received our trike frame, one of the bolts were bent in transit. So we found a bolt of the same dimensions and replaced it.'''

[[File:lebatteries.JPG|600px|center]]

=== Testing and implementation===
We met with the family to test fit our client on the trike. Everything fit perfectly after some adjustments of the seat and the handle bars. Our client rode around on the trike for awhile, and we noticed that his feet kept slipping off of the pedals. So, the family requested that we put straps on the pedals to keep his feet in place while he ride the trike. So, we went to look for pedals with straps at a couple of local cycle shops in town. The only pedals we found were for cycle enthusiast and did not provide much support for your feet. We decided on purchasing velcro straps and slightly modifying them to fit our product.

=== Photos of Completed design ===
Of course we are proud to be apart of the engineering program at Tech. So, we had to put some Eagle pride on the trike!
[[File:final1.jpg|600px|center]]
[[File:final2.jpg|600px|center]]

== Instructions for safe use ==
We provided the family with a user manual that we created. The manual includes: instructions for safe use, diagram of the trike, and a parts list stating where to find replacement parts if needed.

== Project Summary, Reflection ==
We ran into some complication as far as choosing a design. At first we chose a recumbent trike designs, but we ran into some safety and cost efficient issues. So, we ended up going with our net best option, which was a regular trike design. We ran into some issues with finding/ordering parts within our cost range, but we improvised and everything ended up working out. Overall we had a great time building this trike for our client, and have learned a lot doing so. We are proud of our final product and stand behind it fully.
