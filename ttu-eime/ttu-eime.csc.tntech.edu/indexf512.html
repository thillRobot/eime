A child having issues with fine motor skills desires an item that will allow her to focus on controlling her fingers.  A primary concentration for the design of the toy is help the child develop her finger manipulation so that she will be able to mature in her sensory skills.  In addition to this, the item should give the child many fun opportunities to maneuver her fingers in ways that will not only advance her motor skills, but also present an achievable/rewarding challenge for a child of this age.

== Problem Statement/Overview of the Need ==
A child having issues with fine motor skills desires an item that will allow her to focus on controlling her fingers.  A primary concentration for the design of the toy is help the child develop her finger manipulation so that she will be able to mature in her sensory skills.  In addition to this, the item should give the child many fun opportunities to maneuver her fingers in ways that will not only advance her motor skills, but also present an achievable/rewarding challenge for a child of this age.

== Design Specifications  ==
'''''Priority Requests from the Parents'''''

* Must be portable
* Must include a lock &amp; key mechanism
* Must be lightweight
* Must include bows within mechanisms
* Must be durable
* Must provide interesting challenges for a young child

'''''Additional Desires from the Parents'''''

* Possibly include references from the movie '''TROLLS'''
* Possibly include anything about Princesses
* Possibly include the color 'Pink' in many mechanisms
* Possibly have a mechanism with doors to open and close

== Background Research ==
'''1.) Similar, Existing Products:'''

There are many similar products available today for a child who wishes to develop their sensory and motor skills.  They each provide interesting and creative tasks for a child to complete.  There are fidget boards, sensory games, and busy boards of many types that provide latches, locks, and mechanisms that will keep a child entertained for hours on end.  From the existing products, it is can be seen that the boards are oftentimes specialized for a certain child or adult, and this fact causes difficulty for the boards be mass-produced.  A majority of the similar products are actually 'DIY' projects, which cause the product to have many, many variations on the general idea of a fidget board.  

'''2.) Availability of Current Products:'''

Within the concepts presented, there are very few options that are mass-produced.  Thus, upon request, a specialty board that would be built by an avid 'DIY-er' is oftentimes created for each individual consumer. This facet of the product increases the unique qualities of the item, but also raises the price by a great amount due to the time spent by the producer.  The typical price range is approximately $150-$800, depending on the complexity, the intricate qualities, and the availability of the mechanisms desired.

'''3.) Downfalls/Potential Improvements Upon Current Market:'''

A huge downfall, upon research, for the current products on the market, is the fact that most fidget boards on the market are simply 20 minute 'DIY' projects that someone throws together on a piece of plywood.  An advantage of our project is that it will be a well-crafted and more intricate item than almost anything else available on the market.  While most products available are merely mechanisms on a single flat board, our product will, essentially, have 4 times the amount of available space for mechanisms as we have our main design as a rectangular prism.  Also, there is no mass-produced version of a 'standard' fidget board available.  This, by itself, raises the prices of any fidget board available today.  Our fidget board will not have the 'labor costs' which cause the uptick in prices in similar products.



Listed below are some products made by competitors:

== Conceptual Design ==

=== Design Concept 1 ===

The first concept is a fixed 2'x2'x3' rectangular-prism-shaped design that would be made out of MDF or a type of lightweight wood that would be easy for the child's guardian to pick up and move. It would made of an efficient, lightweight wood which would be cheaper and much more durable than aluminum.  Also, the material would be able to withstand minor bending and occasional damage from the child. It would have a wider base for stability and a flat (perpendicular) roof/top. It would also be portable since it would have handles that would make it easier to carry around.           

&lt;gallery>
File:Isometric_DOM_Conceptual_Design_TTU_Trinkets.PNG
File:Corner_DOM_Conceptual_Design_TTU_Trinkets.PNG
&lt;/gallery>

=== Design Concept 2 ===
This concept would also be in the shape of a rectangular prism and it would maintain the lightweight design in order to be easily moved around.  The dimensions for the prism would be 2'x2'x3'.  In this design, though, we would use metal or plastic as it would provide a major amount of durability. Also, in this design, there would be rolling wheels that can lock in place provides so as to provide easy transport for the guardian by simply pushing it and then locking the wheels in place  so the item can be used by the child. However, the cost to produce this item would be much greater as compared to the previous design involving wood.  In addition to this, the use of metal would cause this concept be much heavier than a plastic or wood design.  Another issue would be creating or finding someone who able to make this unique design out of plastic in a cost-effective manner.

=== Design Concept 3 ===
This concept is a folding cube designed for easy storage.  The dimensions for this concept would be 2'x2'x2'.  This design would be compact and easy to transport anywhere.  This concept provides great accessibility for the child's needs.  However, this design could be a potential hazard for the child if, for instance, the concept folded up and fell over while she was using it.  As with the first design, this cube would be made out of wood.  For this concept, the wood would make the design very durable, quite affordable, and also extremely portable.  This material would also be much easier to work with when comparing it to metal since there is such a weight difference between the two.



'''Note:'''
With each design, there would be a variety of mechanisms attached, such as (but not limited to):

Lock &amp; Key, Fidget Spinner, Gearing System to Manipulate, Door Stop, Keyboard, Deadbolt Lock, Gate Hinge, Belt Buckle, Geo-Boards, Calculator, Light Switches, Magnets, Etch-a-Sketch, Zippers

'''''Design Concept 1''''' appears to be the sure winner due to the ease of use, looks, and simplicity.

== Detailed Design ==

=== Description of Selected Design  ===

Here, for the selected design, we have taken the general aspects of our 'Design Concept 1' but then included various details to make the toy appeal to a two-year-old girl (i.e. make it more girly).  The following is a much more detailed description of the selected design.

*Our general design is a modified rectangular prism sensory board. 
*The main material is white oak wood for our rectangular prism design. 
*This design will come with 4 side panels, 1 top panel, and thin, angled panels to add stability to the base. 
*The corners will also have edges that are essentially 'rounded off.'
*The top panel will have a princess-themed aspect, including a pop-up troll and a pink castle for her enjoyment.
*Each side panel will have particular sensory themes to the individual sides.

=== Analyses of Design ===
After considering many different types of materials available, we concluded that, due to ease of manufacturing, strength, light weight, and aesthetically pleasing qualities, White Oak Wood was the best material to use for the base of our project.  Other materials, such as MDF or Maple Wood, were either too heavy, hard to work with, or unreliable/not durable when placed under stress.  

==== Engineering Analysis 1 ====
Here, we have focused on the mass and geometric properties that will be present for the general shape of mechanism.

Approximate Mass: 35 lbs

Box Total Volume:  19,008 cubic inches

Box Total Surface Area:  3,132 square inches

Since there will be handles on each side of the design, the mass will not be an issue for an adult to carry.

==== Engineering Analysis 2 ====
In this analysis, we focused on the sensory skills that the child would develop with each mechanism added.

*Lock and Key - finger manipulation and torquing of the hand
*Light Switches - implementation of an everyday item into her finger manipulation repertoire
*Deadbolt Lock - everyday item for finger manipulation
*Calculator - teaching her at a young age to become an engineer (and improve finger dexterity/precision)
*Zipper - implementation of an everyday item into her finger manipulation repertoire
*Wall Outlet &amp; Plugin - to teach a common skill in a proper and safe environment for a two-three year old
*Fidget Spinner - implement a fun/familiar toy to provide an enthralling, playful experience 
*Keyboard - allow the child to play with an object appearing very soon in their daily lives
*Computer Mouse - to gain experience using an important, common object appearing in society
*Etch-a-Sketch - provide a fun and creative way to implement motor skills and develop her mind
*Gearing System - to allow her to develop an idea in how a gearing system works
*Door Stop - to slightly annoy her parents and have a fun way to practice finger manipulation with a reward
*Doorknob - practice a daily, critical skill for the action of twisting the hand
*Multiple Baby Wipe Doors - including various types of felts/carpet/materials to develop touch/sensory skills
*Spinning Wheel - for the child to visualize how something rotates and how to input motion
*White Board &amp; Markers - for creativity and development of finger/hand/arm motion and visualizing thoughts
*Push Button - a common finger manipulation
*Shirt Button - for her to develop the motor skills to complete this everyday task
*Gate Lock - another lock for her to develop her finger manipulation
*Shoelaces - provides practice into an essential motor skill used in everyday life
*Clock - lets the child learn the basics of an essential part of society through finger manipulation
*Geo-Board - allows her to manipulate her fingers and twist her wrist to visualize a design
*Holes for Shapes - teaches her the basics of how shapes work through finger manipulation

==== Engineering Analysis 3 ====
In this analysis, it was determined that for the general, simplistic design, it would be very difficult for a young girl to push the toy when she is playing with it as the force of friction would be approximately 25 lb.  Also, if she were to push on the top corner of the box, the toy would only tip over if a force of 16.66 lb was applied.  Tipping, however, is highly unlikely to happen as, in our specific, chosen design, there is an additional wider base on the bottom to make it more difficult to tip. (Notice that there is an implied normal force equal to the weight through the center of the block)

=== Assembly Instructions ===
This project was designed to have minimal assembly for the child and/or parents. The child will have additional toys for their enjoyment within the storage box that is contained on one of the sides of the frame.  There will be add-ons for the castle (including dolls from the movie "Trolls"), a handle for the gearing mechanism, and the markers/erasers for the dry-erase board. Beyond this, there is, by design, no assembly required.

=== Testing and Implementation===
* ''Testing'' - We were able to test this product through performing the actions required by each mechanism within the entire toy.  Every apparatus was in good working order at the time of the testing.
* ''Delivery'' - The product will be delivered directly to the family at the TEIS office in Cookeville on 4/30/18 at 4:00 pm.
* ''Family's Use'' - This product is meant to be used by the two-year-old girl to improve her finger manipulation skills.

== Instructions for Safe Use ==
This product is designed for a child, approximate ages 2-5, to play with and use extensively.  This toy will allow one to complete many daily tasks that that involve finger manipulation.  The parent must ensure that the child knows to avoid the mesh of the gears (even with the enhanced protection provided).  Also, the parent should supervise the child to ensure that the many devices are used in the proper manner.  Other than this, the product should be safe for a child, of recommended age, to use.
Do not use the device unless supervised by an adult that fully understands how to safely use this product.

== Project Summary, Reflection ==
As a whole, this project has helped everyone involved gain experience in the design, testing, and implementation of ideas involved in a typical engineering project.  The desired goal of this project was to give a two-year-old girl many different mechanisms to manipulate her fingers challenging yet entertaining way.  Additionally, upon the request of the family, some details, such as a pink-based color-scheme and a overall "Trolls" theme, were to be included as this would make the toy much more captivating for the little girl.  With the help of Dr. Canfield, donations of additional materials and work-space by group member Majed Alqasemi, and many hours of preparation and execution, the project has become a great success.  Overall, our group was grateful for the opportunity to help someone in need, and we all appreciate the valuable engineering experience involved in the design and implementation of this project.
