== Abstract ==
Students in the Special Education Program at Cookeville High School have to maintain physical fitness, but also should have fun while doing so.  A bike powered by a rowing motion increases upper body strength and is fun to operate.  The Special Education department has two rowing bicycles that cannot be used anymore.  One is powered only on the backwards pull motion, is not adjustable, and does not have foot rests or fittings.  The other is difficult to operate, does not move fast, and again does not have foot rests or fittings.

| style="width: 33%;" | This design employs pivotal steering.  The column with the handle bars attached to it is fixed to a central shaft, but the column is allowed to pivot front to back for the rowing motion.  when the user moves the column side to side, the central shaft rotates.  At the end of the shaft is a tab where two rods are attached with revolute joints.  One rod connects to the left wheel hub the other connects to the right hub.  The wheel hubs are allowed to rotate about a vertical axis.  When the central shaft rotates the rods push or pull the wheels inward or outward. || style="width: 33%;" | This is the existing steering design used on previous bikes.  It uses cables wrapped around a spool.  When these cables are pulled, the spool turns thus turning the front wheel.  Pulling the cables is done by rotating the steering wheel || style="width: 33%;" | This design is a fly-by-wire steering concept.  It combines the existing steer by cable design and the pivotal steering design.  The steering wheel will turn a torque sensor which tells an actuator via wires or wireless to turn the central shaft.  The central shaft will then rotate and operate the same steering mechanism as the forward section of the pivotal steering design.

=== Drivetrain ===
All drivetrain concepts attempt to provide power on the forward and backward stoke of the rowing motion.

| style="width: 25%;" | This design achieves push and pull power through gears and free hubs.  The column with the handle bars pushes against a box that is fixed to a lateral shaft.  The column is free to move side to side within the box to allow for pivotal steering.  When the box is pushed back and forth, the shaft it is mounted to rotates.  On the left end of the shaft is a sprocket.  A chain connects this sprocket to a free hub that is mounted to another lateral shaft located at the back of the bike. On the right end of the forward lateral shaft is a spur gear that meshes with another spur gear mounted on a parallel shaft.  The gears reverse the rotation of the shaft and allow for power to be applied on the pulling stroke.  On the other end of this parallel shaft is a sprocket.  A chain connects this sprocket to a free hub that is mounted to the rear lateral shaft.  The rear lateral shaft receives power from the free hubs which drives a sprocket mounted at the center of the shaft.  Free hubs engage in one direction, so one free hub will be sliding freely while the other provides power and vice versa.  A chain connects the sprocket at the center of the rear lateral shaft to a sprocket mounted on the rear axle which then provide power to the wheels or wheel. || style="width: 25%;" | In this design, the column that will be pushed and pulled will push against a box that is fixed to a lateral shaft.  Perpendicularly attached to the bottom of the lateral shaft will be a bar.  A chain will be attached to this bar and will run back to a free hub that is the same for Concept design #1.  Another chain will run forward and be attached to a sprocket mounted on a lateral shaft up front.  This lateral shaft will have gears similar to the gears in Concept Design #1, and the power will travel through the same design in Design Concept #1 past the gears in mesh.  The sprockets used in this design will have spiral springs mounted on the side that will retract the chain when it's not in tension.  || style="width: 25%;" | This design has been used on a previous bike in an attempt to provide power to the wheels on both the push and pull motion.  The column that you are pushing and pulling will pivot about a revolute joint about three fourths of the way down the column.  A link will connect the bottom of the column to the crank that is fixed to a sprocket.  When the column is pushed or pulled, the crank will drive the sprocket thus driving the wheels.  A bungie cord attached to the crank will overcome the toggle position of the crank. || style="width: 25%;" | This design is the same as the crank, however pedals like on a bicycle which will be operated by hand will provide the power.

== Detailed Design ==
=== Description of selected design  ===
The design is broken into three major components: Steering, Drivetrain, and Frame. 
*The steering system will primarily reused from the old bike. It utilizes a pull-pull cable system as shown in steering concept 2 above.
*The drivetrain is a modification of drivetrain concept 1 from above. It uses crossed chains to achieve the reversal of direction instead of the gears shown in the concept.
*The frame is a a modification of the frame from the old bike. It will be modified to allow for the new gear train and extended.

=== Detailed description of selected design ===
The new bike will reuse many of the components from the current bike and will essentially be an extensive drivetrain modification with other minor additions.


[[File:Gear_Train_Schematic.JPG| 400px | center]]

The drivetrain consists of three live axials. The first axle is the input. It is connected to a lever arm which is pushed/pulled by the rider. On this axial are two sprockets rigidly attached to the axial.

The second axle has three sprockets attached to it. One of the "Sprocket 2"s is chain driven off of "Sprocket 1" in the traditional way. The other "Sprocket 2" chain travels in a figure 8 path, reversing the direction of the motion. A guide block of low friction material will be placed at the intersection point to reduce the drag between the chains. The "Sprocket 2"s are riding on one one way bearings that engage in opposite directions

The third axle is attached to the wheels with a ratcheting cassette attached to the center. The cassette allows for noninvasive changes of the final drive gear ratio.

The front of frame will remain largely unchanged from the previous iteration of this bike. Will will extend the rear of the bike allowing the seat to be shifted back to make room for foot pedals. These pedals will allow the rider to actively engage their legs, a request of the customer. Furthermore, the extended frame will allow for the longer chain runs necessary for our gear train.

The steering will remain largely unchanged in our bike. Upon analysis, we found that the previous steering system provided sufficient turning capabilities and required minimal modifications.

=== Analysis ===
==== Engineering analysis 1 ====
'''Gear Train Calculated'''

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6s_UhmkBLQfaUNsTENhckcxeUE/view?usp=sharing Calculation Spreadsheet]


These are the primary inputs to the spreadsheet. Below are the primary assumptions and target outputs used for all of our sprocket calculations.

'''Assumpions'''
*Maximum rider arm extension = 18" 
*Bike weight = 100lb
*Rider weight = 80lb
*Maximum rider pushing force = 15 lb

'''Target Outputs'''
*Target bike speed = 6 ft/s
*Max cycles to reach target speed = 5
*Target Cadence = 60 cycles/minute

[[File:Inputs.JPG]]



This calculation does a straightforward energy balance for an ideal system. We used it to get a general sense of what to expect from subsequent calculations. It takes the max force, bike mass, rider mass, and target velocity as inputs and solves for distance. The distance is then converted to cycles.


[[File:Energy_Balance.JPG]]


This calculation takes an input of cycles per minute and translates that to bike speed.

[[File:Constant_CPM.JPG]]


This calculation takes the length of the input lever arm, the inefficiencies of the different stages, and the standard assumptions listed above. It converts the force into a torque and runs that through the the gear train to get the torque at the output shaft. A generic loss term (discussed below) is then subtracted to take into account wheel friction and other losses outside of the drivetrain. The net torque is then converted back to a force acting at the point of contact on the road. At this point, the moment of inertia of the wheel is assumed to be negligible and acceleration is found using F = m*a.

The loss term used in this calculation is equivalent to the torque required to keep the bike from rolling down an incline of alpha degrees as shown in the picture below.

This is a stress analysis for the frame in Ansys. We used a 100lb load to simulate the weight of the child.

==== Engineering analysis 3 ====
Steering Analysis

The steering, consist of 2 spools and a wire. A rotation of the steering wheel causes an equal rotation in spool1, this in turn causes a displacement of the wire and a rotation of the spool2. 
Below is the analysis of the steering box.

&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />
Turning Radius Analysis
&lt;br />
Turning radius is the radius of circular turn that a machine can make.&lt;br />  There are different factors that can affect the turning radius&lt;br />
1) The distance between the tires ( the width of the Rowing Bike is 30 inches)
&lt;br />
2) The spools (diameter and angle of rotation)
&lt;br />
3) The speed of the machine ( for this Rowing Bike this will not be a major problem because the estimated maximum speed is 2.4mph)

&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />
&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />
[[File:Turing Radius.JPG| 500px]]
&lt;br />&lt;br />

In conclusion&lt;br />
The maximum angle of spool1 is 90 degrees and the estimated maximum turning radius at this angle is 73.50 inches.

=== Prototype Process ===
In order to test our drivetrain concept design, we built a prototype with parts from the Mechanical Engineering shop.&lt;br />
Testing proved successful and confirmed our design.
